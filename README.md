# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Course

## Goal

- Create a model that understands video.
- Experiments) Can genetic algorithms be applied to deep learning models?

## Plan

1. Understanding deep learning at a hugging pace
2. Fine-tune your model
3. Understanding existing models with video as input
4. Create a model that understands video with fine-tuning
5. Train the model
6. Apply a genetic algorithm

## 1. Understanding deep learning at a hugging pace
